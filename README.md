"Groups" is a board game in which 2 players (red and blue) participate. On a board, the players go alternating shifts. On each turn, he enters one of his discs horizontally or vertically from the edge of the board, with the purpose of forming groups of their color. A group is a set of positions of the player's color, which are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Whoever has the largest group wins!
